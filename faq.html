        <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">20% </strong>  of your income goes to your financial goals: <br> savings, investments, paying down debt, student loans, or a down payment on your first home. <br>
        <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">30% </strong>  goes to your wants: shopping, dinners out, travel, or entertainment.</p>

                    <br>

               <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 1: </strong>  Look at your payslips and give each dollar a job into the <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">50-20-30  </strong> categories. By organising your money into categories, you will know how much money you will be saving at the end of the month.

                <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 2: </strong>  Let's take a look at your spending habits when you are not on a budget. What did you buy in your everyday life over a month? Write everything down as detailed as possible. 
                <br>
                <br>

                 <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">Step 3: </strong>  After putting your money into set categories (living essentials, financial goals, wants), it is also good to see what you can cut off. Perhaps you have a subscription (Hulu, Netflix) that you are no longer using?</p>

          <div class="money"> According to Career Contessa, when it comes to debt it depends wether it is student loans or credit card debt. 
            When it comes to your credit card, it is best to keep your usage to 30 percent or less of the limit. For your debt in general (including car loans, house loans, personal loans), the target number is 20 percent or less.
            <br>
                 <br>

            Still not sure? Ask yourself these questions to gauge: Can you only make the minimum on your payments? Are you skipping certain bills to pay off others? Are your cards maxed out? Are you living paycheck to paycheck?
                 <br>
                      <br>

            If you’re maxed out on one or several cards, come up with a dedicated plan to pay them down immediately. Focus on paying off the card with the highest interest first, then pick the remaining ones off one at a time. Use this credit payment calculator to help guide you:

<div class="money"> According to Your Money Under 30, here are the Do’s and Don'ts when you are with a partner and have not been married yet.
              <br>
              <br>

            Marriage does provides certain legal and financial safeguards for both couples. However, many couples are managing a joint budget without being married. So here are some things to watch out for.
              <br>
              <br>

          <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DON’T share assets: </strong>  Do not buy anything together. That goes for houses, cars, and furniture, and especially checking accounts. Yes, you love him or her. But if things go sour, each takes their own.
              <br>
              <br>

             <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DON’T share debts: </strong>  As tempting as it often is, I would recommend that you don’t cosign a loan for your partner. Whether you stay together or not, if he or she defaults, you either pay up or lose your credit. Cosigners should be family members. End of story.
              <br>
              <br>

          <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">DO share expenses: </strong> Avoid the “free-for-all” approach to budgeting that I mentioned above. Before you move in, decide whether you will share expenses fifty-fifty or proportionately based upon salary. You may consider opening a joint checking account just for paying expenses. This should only be for bills and groceries.
              <br>
              <br>

            <strong style="color: #5abfb4;">  DO plan for the worst: </strong>  Although unlikely, consider the possibility that one of you could die. You’ll need to choose beneficiaries for everything from insurance policies to retirement plans.
              <br>
